# Algorithm Documentation: Fitting Polygons Inside a Main Polygon

This algorithm is designed to find fitting positions for a foreground polygon within a main polygon while considering potential obstacles such as holes and background polygons. The algorithm identifies valid positions where the foreground polygon can be placed without overlapping obstacles or exceeding the boundaries of the main polygon.

## Algorithm Overview

The key steps of the algorithm are:

1. **Input Data:**
   - `mainPolygonPoints`: (green points) The vertices of the main polygon that defines the overall bounding area.
   - `holePolygons`: (purpul points) A set of polygons representing holes or obstacles inside the main polygon.
   - `backgroundPolygon`: (black points) A background polygon used for projecting the fitting positions.
   - `foregroundPolygon`: (red points) The polygon that we aim to fit inside the main polygon without overlapping holes or going out of bounds.

</p>

2. **Fitting Procedure:**
   - **Center Calculation**: Calculate the center of the foreground polygon.
   - **Projection**: Project this center onto the background polygon to generate candidate points for fitting.
   - **Check Fitting**: For each candidate position, the algorithm checks whether the foreground polygon can fit by verifying that it does not overlap with holes or exit the main polygon.

3. **Collision and Validity Checks:**
   - **Edge Projection**: To ensure no overlap with other polygons, the algorithm projects polygon edges onto certain axes and checks for overlap using the **Separating Axis Theorem (SAT)**.
   - **Valid Position**: A position is valid if the foreground polygon stays within the main polygon and does not overlap any holes.


### Output

The output of the algorithm is a set of valid positions where the foreground polygon can be placed within the main polygon. This set may include multiple positions, depending on the configuration of the input data. Each position is represented as a collection of vertices that define the corners of the foreground polygon in its valid placement. If no valid positions are found, the output will indicate that fitting the foreground polygon is not possible within the given constraints.

## Usage Example

```javascript
const fittingPositions = findFittingPositions(mainPolygonPoints, holePolygons, backgroundPolygon, foregroundPolygon);
console.log(fittingPositions);
```

This call will attempt to find a valid fitting position for the `foregroundPolygon` within `mainPolygonPoints`, considering obstacles (`holePolygons`) and potential background projections (`backgroundPolygon`).

## Notes

- **Edge Cases**: The algorithm handles cases where polygons are degenerate (edges collapse to a point) by returning `null` for such projections.
- **Efficiency**: The projection and collision-checking steps ensure efficient validation of potential positions for the foreground polygon.
